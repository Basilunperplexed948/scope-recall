# scope-recall design

## Positioning

`scope-recall` is a Hermes local memory provider focused on **current-turn recall** plus **durable shared semantic memory**.

It inherits the useful policy ideas from OpenClaw `memory-lancedb-pro`:

- no stale previous-turn injection
- permanent shared memory for durable facts
- local scratch isolation for temporary chat/thread/session context
- conservative gating
- bounded recall budget

But its implementation is intentionally split into two clear layers:

1. **SQLite truth layer**
2. **LanceDB vector companion layer**

That split is deliberate. SQLite is the durable source of truth; LanceDB is the retrieval accelerator/semantic companion.

## Goals

1. Fix cross-turn topic bleed caused by queued previous-turn recall.
2. Keep durable local truth in a simple audit-friendly store.
3. Add semantic/hybrid retrieval without making the vector store the only source of truth.
4. Respect Hermes built-in curated memory as the source of truth for `memory` tool writes.
5. Share durable `user`/`memory`/`project`/`ops` facts across windows/chats for the same user + agent identity.
6. Isolate `general` scratch captures strongly enough for gateway multi-chat / multi-topic use.
7. Preserve an offline-capable default path for local operation and open-source onboarding.

## Non-goals for V1

- full OpenClaw `memory-lancedb-pro` parity
- LLM-backed created/merged/skipped governance parity
- multi-tier summarization / promotion / compression orchestration
- cloud-only dependency requirement
- forcing external embedding APIs for basic functionality

## Layer split

### Layer A — built-in curated memory

Authoritative files:

- `$HERMES_HOME/memories/USER.md`
- `$HERMES_HOME/memories/MEMORY.md`

These are live-read during recall when curated-memory policy allows it. `on_memory_write` is intentionally an observational no-op: Hermes can notify the provider, but this provider must not mirror curated writes into SQLite.

Default policy is conservative for gateways: global curated files are read in single-user/no-`user_id` contexts, but explicit `user_id` contexts must opt in via `curated_memory.mode: profile-global` or `curated_memory.mode: explicit-users` plus `allowed_user_ids`.

Reason:

If provider code mirrors built-in `memory` writes into a second database, replace/remove operations drift and stale entries survive. Live-reading the curated files keeps provider recall aligned with Hermes native memory behavior.

### Layer B — SQLite truth layer

Stored in:

- `$HERMES_HOME/scope-recall/memory.sqlite3`

Used for:

- turn captures
- provider tool writes
- lexical lookup
- runtime audit trail
- future migration source of truth

SQLite schema includes:

- `scope_id`
- `platform`
- `user_id`
- `chat_id`
- `thread_id`
- `gateway_session_key`
- `agent_identity`
- `agent_workspace`
- `session_id`
- `source`
- `target`
- `content`
- `summary`
- timestamps

An FTS5 side table provides fast lexical retrieval.

### Layer C — LanceDB vector companion

Stored in:

- `$HERMES_HOME/scope-recall/lancedb/`

Used for:

- semantic nearest-neighbor retrieval
- hybrid ranking with lexical candidates
- future pluggable embedder upgrades

It duplicates retrieval-ready fields from SQLite plus a `vector` column, but it is **not** the truth layer.

## Why SQLite truth + LanceDB companion

This architecture gives us:

- stable local truth independent of vector backend changes
- easier migrations and backups
- reproducible lexical fallback
- semantic search when available
- a cleaner open-source story than a provider whose name and reality drift apart

## Retrieval model

### Current-turn only

- `prefetch(query)` retrieves against the *current* user query
- `queue_prefetch()` is intentionally a no-op

This is the core anti-topic-bleed decision.

### Conservative gating

Skip recall when query is:

- empty
- too short
- greeting/noise/trivial text

### Hybrid ranking

Current config supports:

- `lexical`
- `vector`
- `hybrid`

Default is `hybrid`.

Important rule:

- if only lexical is available, use lexical score directly
- if only vector is available, use vector score directly
- only blend when both sides exist

That prevents good curated lexical hits from being suppressed merely because there is no vector twin.

## Embedders

### Configured default: Gemini OpenAI-compatible API

The shipped runtime config now targets a hosted embedder by default:

- provider: `openai-compatible`
- model: `gemini-embedding-001`
- dimensions: `3072`

That is the recommended high-quality hosted path for deployments that provide credentials.

### Runtime fallback: local-hash

When the configured API embedder is unavailable, runtime falls back to the offline deterministic `local-hash` embedder.

That fallback is *not* a true semantic embedding model, but it gives us:

- no hard dependency on external APIs for basic bootstrap
- deterministic tests when we explicitly select it
- workable paraphrase tolerance for practical operations language
- a safe degraded path when credentials are absent

### Local model path: sentence-transformers

When you want a real local embedding model instead of a hosted API, set `vector.embedder.provider` to `sentence-transformers`.

The provider aliases `local-model`, `local-embedding`, and `huggingface` also resolve to the same backend.

Typical local model choices include:

- `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`

This keeps the retrieval pipeline unchanged while swapping only the embedder implementation.

## Scope model: durable shared memory + local scratch

`scope-recall` deliberately avoids both extremes: it does not make every row global, and it does not lock every useful fact into one chat/window.

### Shared durable scope

Shared durable scope is built from:

1. `platform`
2. `agent_workspace`
3. `agent_identity`
4. `user_id`

Rows with targets `user`, `memory`, `project`, and `ops` are stored in this shared scope. They can be recalled across chat/thread/session boundaries for the same user and agent identity when the current query is relevant.

### Local runtime scope

Local runtime scope starts with the shared durable scope and adds:

1. `gateway_session_key` when Hermes provides it; otherwise
2. `chat_id`
3. `thread_id` when present

Rows with target `general` stay in this local scope. Raw turn captures and temporary scratch notes therefore do not leak from one group/topic/session into another.

### Accessible scope set

At runtime, normal recall and scoped tool actions use the deduped set:

```text
[current local runtime scope, shared durable scope]
```

This lets one user recall durable memory from another window while still preventing cross-user, cross-agent, and cross-local-scratch access. ID-based update/merge/delete paths must use this accessible set, never raw global ids alone. Ordinary update/merge paths also reject shared/local mode changes so a durable row cannot accidentally become globally visible `general` scratch, and a local scratch merge cannot swallow a shared durable memory.

## Migration plan

### Implemented now

On first init:

- if legacy `$HERMES_HOME/lancepro/memory.sqlite3` exists and new DB is absent, copy it into `$HERMES_HOME/scope-recall/memory.sqlite3`
- if legacy config exists and new config is absent, copy it forward
- expose migration status in stats

### OpenClaw historical imports

OpenClaw `memory-lancedb-pro` history is **not** auto-attached.

Instead, release docs and a one-shot importer now define the supported path:

- `docs/migration.md`
- `docs/differences-from-memory-lancedb-pro.md`
- `scripts/import.openclaw.memory_lancedb_pro.py`

The importer now uses a stable source fingerprint + import ledger so rerunning the same source is idempotent instead of duplicating rows.

This keeps the boundary explicit: old OpenClaw LanceDB stores must be transformed into `scope-recall` SQLite truth rows before the companion index is rebuilt.

### Vector companion sync and repair

The companion LanceDB layer syncs incrementally from SQLite truth on init by comparing stable ids and `updated_at` values:

- missing vector rows are embedded and inserted
- stale vector rows absent from SQLite are deleted
- duplicate physical vector rows for the same id are collapsed to the newest matching row
- unchanged rows are left alone
- after sync, stats record physical row count, unique id count, and duplicate extra rows

If LanceDB delete/upsert fails, SQLite remains authoritative and the provider marks vector state as `needs_repair`; the truth-row write is not reported as lost.

Full rebuild is no longer the default init path. For deep maintenance or release-grade storage hygiene, run `scripts/repair.vector_index.py` to rebuild the LanceDB companion from SQLite truth with an automatic backup.

### Operational follow-up outside source readiness

Source-tree readiness and public documentation are separate from live deployment. Operators still need to:

- decide when to remove the deprecated `lancepro` shim in a later, explicitly announced release
- restart or reload the target Hermes service after installing a new checkout
- run a live runtime smoke test under the intended service profile before claiming gateway freshness

## Tool exposure

Primary-agent default tools:

- `scope_recall_store`
- `scope_recall_search`
- `scope_recall_forget`
- `scope_recall_update`
- `scope_recall_merge`
- `scope_recall_export` with `scope_only=true`
- `scope_recall_stats`

Operator-only maintenance tools require `maintenance_tools_enabled=true` and fail closed otherwise:

- `scope_recall_dedupe`
- `scope_recall_govern`
- `scope_recall_hygiene`
- `scope_recall_repair`
- `scope_recall_export(scope_only=false)`

Subagents do not get tool schemas and cannot use them.

## Open-source packaging expectations

For V1 release/publish, keep these gates green:

1. package and plugin metadata stay on `1.0.3` until the next patch release
2. public maturity wording remains beta / release-candidate until broader field testing justifies a production-stable classifier
3. README, DESIGN, CHANGELOG, stability contract, migration docs, and upstream-difference docs stay in sync
4. local release gate passes with `python scripts/check.release.py`
5. live gateway freshness is verified separately after installing or restarting a real Hermes service
6. the deprecated `lancepro` shim remains covered by tests until its removal is explicitly announced in a later release

## Current status

What is already real now:

- plugin source is packaged as an unpacked Hermes plugin under `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/scope-recall`
- SQLite truth layer exists
- LanceDB companion layer exists
- hybrid retrieval path exists
- legacy local rename migration exists
- focused tests for loading / hybrid recall / curated memory / stats pass
- release docs include migration notes, upstream differences, a V1 stability contract, and an OpenClaw import script
- vector sync repairs stale ids and duplicate physical rows during normal initialization
- stats distinguish vector physical rows, unique ids, and duplicate extra rows
- top-level package import is lightweight enough for clean wheel/venv checks without Hermes runtime modules
- release automation runs the full `scripts/check.release.py` gate in CI

What remains outside source-tree readiness:

- live Hermes gateway freshness still requires a restart/reload plus runtime smoke verification after deployment
- publishing a new release requires pushing a clean commit, waiting for remote CI, and creating or updating the appropriate next version tag/release according to the existing version line
