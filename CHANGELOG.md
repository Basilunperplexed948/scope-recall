# Changelog

All notable changes to `scope-recall` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Added `capture_filters.py` to centralize automatic capture hygiene and block runtime-wrapper text such as recent Telegram context, context-compaction handoffs, skill-review meta prompts, and secret-like literals before they enter SQLite or vector storage.
- Added regression coverage for capture filtering, structured content capture, context-wrapper rejection, and default assistant-response non-capture.
- Added storage receipts to `scope_recall_store`, `scope_recall_update`, and successful `scope_recall_merge` responses so governance companions can close promotion/merge/rejection loops against concrete write evidence.
- Added conservative curated-memory policy controls: global `USER.md` / `MEMORY.md` recall now requires opt-in for explicit gateway `user_id` contexts unless an allowlist/profile-global mode is configured.
- Added stable OpenClaw import fingerprint material for missing/invalid legacy timestamps so dry-run/import reruns remain idempotent.

### Changed
- Changed default automatic capture posture to reduce raw `general` noise: `capture_assistant=false`, `min_capture_length=40`, and `capture_hard_max_chars=2500`.
- Kept short extracted durable candidates eligible for capture even when raw-turn capture uses a higher minimum length, so concise user preferences and ops facts are not lost.
- Treat exact semantic-merge matches as duplicates rather than no-op merges, preserving existing memory ids without rewriting content.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-16

### Security
- Scoped all ID-based write paths (`scope_recall_update`, `scope_recall_merge`, query-driven delete plumbing, and dedupe deletes) to the current accessible scope set so a caller that learns an inaccessible memory id cannot update, merge, or delete that row from a different user, sibling agent, or local chat/thread/session scratch scope. Ordinary merge calls now fail if any requested source id is missing or inaccessible, including explicit-content merges that would otherwise silently overwrite the target. Ordinary update/merge calls now also reject shared/local mode changes, preventing durable rows from becoming cross-window `general` scratch or local merges from swallowing shared durable memory.
- Restricted maintenance tools behind explicit `maintenance_tools_enabled=true`. `scope_recall_dedupe`, `scope_recall_govern`, and `scope_recall_repair` are hidden from the default tool schema and fail closed unless operator mode is enabled; `scope_recall_export(scope_only=false)` also requires operator mode.
- Changed `scope_recall_dedupe` default behavior to current-scope-only. Cross-scope dedupe remains available only as an operator maintenance action.

### Changed
- Reframed the scope model as permanent shared memory plus local scratch scope: durable `user`/`memory`/`project`/`ops` rows follow the same user + agent identity across windows/chats, while `general` rows stay local.
- Aligned package metadata, plugin metadata, release checker, README, stability contract, and design docs with the public `v1.0.1` tag.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` to verified wheel data files so installed release docs match the README documentation table.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Declared the first stable V1 release line with explicit provider identity, storage, tool, retrieval, migration, and runtime-freshness contracts in `docs/stability.md`.
- Added V1-grade release checks for stable metadata, required documentation, wheel contents, and public-facing version consistency.
- Kept release-tree scanning focused on `scope-recall` sources when CI clones Hermes into `.hermes-agent-src` for runtime compatibility tests.
- Added a public README structure with badges, quick start, architecture diagram, tool quick reference, troubleshooting notes, and release-gate guidance.

### Changed
- Promoted package and plugin metadata from `0.2.0` to `1.0.0`, while keeping the public package classifier at beta/release-candidate maturity until broader field use.
- Aligned the public Python support floor and CI matrix with the current Hermes runtime requirement of Python 3.11+.
- Tightened V1 documentation around SQLite truth ownership, LanceDB companion-cache rebuildability, and non-goals versus OpenClaw `memory-lancedb-pro` parity.
- Changed GitHub Actions to run `scripts/check.release.py` as the remote CI gate so CI matches the local V1 release audit.
- Replaced agent-specific author/copyright wording with project contributor wording and added `SECURITY.md` plus a `py.typed` marker for public-release hygiene.
- Fixed scope id serialization to avoid delimiter-collision between user/chat/thread/session components and aligned `scope_recall_dedupe(scope_only=false)` with its documented cross-scope semantics.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Added vector audit stats for physical LanceDB row count, unique id count, and duplicate extra row count.
- Added regression coverage for duplicate vector row repair, stale vector row cleanup, vector upsert failure degradation, light top-level package import, and the intentional `on_memory_write` no-op boundary.
- Renamed public provider from `lancepro` to `scope-recall` with a deprecated compatibility shim left in place for the old plugin directory.
- Added SQLite truth store + LanceDB vector companion architecture for hybrid current-turn recall.
- Added scope isolation coverage for `chat_id`, `thread_id`, and `gateway_session_key`.
- Added focused release docs: migration notes, upstream differences, and OpenClaw import guidance.
- Added idempotent OpenClaw import tooling with stable source fingerprints and an `import_ledger`.
- Added release bootstrap files: `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Added GitHub Actions CI and a local `scripts/check.release.py` gate for test/build/secret/path/artifact verification.
- Added `scripts/repair.vector_index.py` to rebuild the LanceDB companion from SQLite truth with backup support.

### Changed
- Switched active Hermes memory provider to `scope-recall`.
- Refactored provider internals by splitting migration logic, recall fusion, capture flow, storage views, and tool handling into dedicated modules.
- Changed vector maintenance from init-time full rebuild toward incremental sync by stable row id and `updated_at`, including stale-row cleanup and duplicate physical-row repair.
- Clarified README and DESIGN documentation to describe the real runtime architecture, configured Gemini OpenAI-compatible default embedder, and local fallback boundary.
- Updated release regression coverage so the default runtime path explicitly verifies fallback to `local-hash` when API embeddings are unavailable, while dimension-rebuild coverage uses an explicit local-hash config override.
- Fixed wheel packaging so the published artifact installs as an importable `scope_recall` package instead of scattering provider modules at site-packages top level.
- Restored Python 3.10/3.11 compatibility in `vector_store.py` by removing 3.12-only f-string quoting syntax.
- Included the OpenClaw import script in wheel data files for public release completeness.
- Preserved SQLite truth writes when LanceDB delete/upsert fails and marked the vector layer `needs_repair` for later repair.
- Kept top-level `import scope_recall` free of Hermes runtime imports; `register()` lazy-loads provider code.
- Documented `on_memory_write` as an intentional observational no-op because curated memory files are live-read instead of mirrored.
- Replaced dynamic `ALTER TABLE` f-string construction with an explicit allowlisted migration mapping and changed test placeholder keys to obvious non-secrets.

### Compatibility
- Legacy `lancepro_store`, `lancepro_search`, and `lancepro_stats` aliases remain accepted during transition.
- Legacy `$HERMES_HOME/lancepro/` SQLite/config storage is migrated forward on first initialization.

### Known limitations
- Vector repair/rebuild is available through `scripts/repair.vector_index.py`, but live gateway runtime freshness still requires an explicit service restart / human-triggered verification after deployment.
- OpenClaw historical imports still require an explicit one-shot import step; they are not automatically reused.
